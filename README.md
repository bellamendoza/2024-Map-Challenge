There are fruit trees all over Berkeley and often in public spaces --in the parks and community gardens, on campus, and on the sidewalks. Using data from [Forage Berkeley](https://forageberkeley.blogspot.com/), a public map that the community can contribute to, I mapped a few of my favorite fruit trees.
